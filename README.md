## My process
First, I structured the HTML, which I believe is correct and semantic. Then, I went to CSS and first made the desktop version. After adjusting the measurement values, I made the media queries to make it responsive. The CSS code is a complete mess and I still need to add an overlay color over the image, which I haven't been able to do so far. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Never start coding the desktop version first.

### Continued development

I want to improve the CSS and finish the project, adding an overlay color over the image, which is what's missing. 

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - It helped me a lot. I don't need to waste time searching on Google or making a post on StackOverflow for possible solution for my problems. It is a great ally for studying.
